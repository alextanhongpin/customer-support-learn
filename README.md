Learn how to help customers with the bugs you released to the wild

## What is this about?
Customer is king, so they say. But people make mistakes, and bugs gets released into production. So how do you handle all those scenarios for customer, and at the same time debug those issues on production, putting yourself in their shoes (it works on my machine, please)?


## Scenario: User is unable to reset password

User has requested a reset password, but is unable to do so even after receiving the email. 

Potential solution:
- do an email swap with your test account so that you can try it on their behalf.

## Scenario: When a user request for a feature

Keep those features into the backlog, and once it reach a certain threshold (or if your user research concludes that it adds value) then execute it!
